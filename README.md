# visitor-badge

**The service is now deployed under a free version of glitch, so it will down if too many requests in the same time**

You can:

1. fork this project and deploy under your glitch account and let it working for yourself, it should be enough.
2. use [hits](https://github.com/dwyl/hits) instead
3. consider a donation :-)

Sorry for the inconvenience.

If you deployed forked project to your stable server and want to provide a free, stable service, which is very kind, please raise an issue to tell me so I can list your service url here:

> Before you do that, **DO update the md5_key in .env file to `guess_what`** so that former users will not lose their count, otherwise the count will start from 1.
